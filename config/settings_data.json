Founded by an engineer, we also look to solve hard technical problems to build apps others can't.<\/p>\n<p>Recently we added a templating engine to Plug in SEO, allowing shop owners to use the full range of Liquid variables and filters. Other apps offer just a couple.<\/p>\n<p>Plug in Speed is the first minifier app for Shopify. We researched and developed unique technology to make this minification happen just-in-time. Other apps break key Shopify features like theme settings and require manual or scheduled runs.<\/p>\n<p>Currently in the works we have a unique solution to the problem many shop owners have with understanding who, when and what changes are made to their theme. It's based on git and again has solid tech under the hood exposed with UX that's deceptively simple.<\/p>\n<p>Working at Plug in Useful as an engineer gives you the opportunity to work on problems like this with a small and very experienced team who care about what they make.<\/p>"
